# Blendle's Employee Handbook

This is a living document with everything we've learned working with people while running a startup. And, of course, we continue to learn. Therefore it's a document that will continue to change. 

**Everything related to working at Blendle and the people of Blendle, made public.**

These are the lessons from three years of working with the people of Blendle. It contains everything from [how our leaders lead](https://www.notion.so/ecfb7e647136468a9a0a32f1771a8f52) to [how we increase salaries](Salary%20Review%20ca74632e293f450dac8408bd650c686f.md), from [how we hire](Hiring%2037871eb513924a348735e5f30c90187e.md) and [fire](Firing%202ebfc808d9ae4dc18ca0378aa3f59bbb.md) to [how we think people should give each other feedback](Our%20Feedback%20Process%2052f6df17b10f404985adfa6a32442a97.md) — and much more.

We've made this document public because we want to learn from you. We're very much interested in your feedback (including weeding out typo's and Dunglish ;)). Email us at hr@blendle.com. If you're starting your own company or if you're curious as to how we do things at Blendle, we hope that our employee handbook inspires you.
